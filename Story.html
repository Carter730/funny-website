      <p>Throughout the strangeness of life, you are most likely to encounter many strange people and occurrences. These experiences become stories to tell your relatives and friends. More common or not, these tales have a good impact on your friends, but what if it could be better? What if you could knock their socks off rather than just make them chuckle a little? With a little thing called good delivery, this dream can come true. Though the process of telling your story, become part of the story; build tension, truly get into it. The climax of your story should be the reigger to their funny bone. In the end, doing this should have a much larger impact on the punch line.</p>
