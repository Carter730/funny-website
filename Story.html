      <p>Throughout the strangeness of life, you are most likely to encounter many strange people and occurrences. These experiences become stories to tell your relatives and friends. More common or not, these tales have a good impact on your friends, but what if it could be better? What if you could knock their socks off rather than just make them chuckle a little? With a little thing called good delivery, this dream can come true. Though the process of telling your story, become part of the story; build tension, truly get into it. The climax of your story should be the reigger to their funny bone. In the end, doing this should have a much larger impact on the punch line.</p>

      <h2>Example Interaction</h2>
      <p>Bill: "Hey Peter, this jokes a bit long, but you wanna hear it anyways?"</p>
      <p>Peter: "Sure, I'm not doin' anything else right now so why not."</p>
      <p>Bill: "Okay, so You know, in parks and stuff, you can get a coke, ginger ale, fanta, etc. Business was going really well, so well I had to hire a guy to help. Right after I hired him though, sales plummeted. Trying to figure out why, I went to a few of my macines. The snacks were fine, but the drinks had a weird noise coming from them, like a crying sorta sound. It was disconcerting, and I didn’t blame people for not buying. The next month was terrible. I spent thousands having techs look at the machines, switching out the cans, nothing worked. Sales plummeted more, and I didn’t have any answers. At the end of my rope I decided to follow my new guy around as he restocked the machines. I found out every machine he would go to, he JAMMED as many cans and bottles as he could in, filling the machines to the brim. I finally found the problem. When you squeeze coke, fanta and ginger ale in the machines so tight, of course they start crying. They become... SODA PRESSED!!! (Peter and Bill laugh very hard together at his personable joke)</p>
