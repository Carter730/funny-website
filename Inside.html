    <p>Inside jokes are references between you and one friend or more can share that can symbolize a past experience. This genre is very important for friendships. This type of comedy can be used quite frequently, but like all jokes, it has a limit. Repeating it can easily make the joke stale and lose its effect. Normally, the longer periods of which this comedy is used, the greater effect it has. It can also be used to share a giggle of nostalgia with your closest friends. Albeit, inside jokes are fantastic, but by all costs, never use an inside joke to someone who wouldn’t know it’s origin. That is an easy way to begin an awkward moment of silence, which is the worst event to receive from comedy.</p>
