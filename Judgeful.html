      <p>Every now and then it’s good at laugh at yourself. This can also be used as an effective form of comedy, a sort of playful judgment. Normally, when you’re with your closer friends, you can get the opportunity to make fun of your friend. When you are doing so, you should try to avoid messing with something more personal about them. Good things to pick at are past experiences, a mistake they’ve made, maybe something they’re wearing. Over all, make fun out of the more nonsensical, simple things about them.</p>

      <h2>Example Interaction</h2>
      <p>(Peter walks into his office after a rough morning)</p>
      <p>Bill: "Wow Peter, you look like trash..."</p>
      <p>Peter: "What do you mean?!"</p>
      <p>Bill: "SERIOUSLY THOUGH! You look like a sad, trashy racoon!" (Bill laughs hard at Peter as Peter slowly begins to laugh as well at himself)
